# mdelh
MDE Lazy Hunter (mdelh) is a Python script for querying the Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) API using URLs, IPs, domains, and file hashes (SHA256, SHA1, MD5). It validates inputs, sends asynchronous queries, and processes results, converting timestamps to Cairo local time. Ideal for automating and speeding up threat intelligence tasks.
