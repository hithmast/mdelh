# Security Policy for MDE Lazy Hunter

## Purpose

This security policy outlines the guidelines and practices for ensuring the security of the MDE Lazy Hunter codebase. The goal is to protect sensitive data, ensure the integrity of the application, and mitigate potential security risks.

## Scope

This policy applies to all developers, contributors, and users of the MDE Lazy Hunter project.

## Security Guidelines

### 1. Code Security

- **Input Validation**: All user inputs must be validated to prevent injection attacks, such as SQL injection or command injection. Use built-in validation libraries and ensure that inputs conform to expected formats.
  
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling to avoid revealing sensitive information in error messages. Log errors securely without exposing stack traces or sensitive data.

- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and libraries to their latest stable versions. Use tools like `pip-audit` or `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### 2. Authentication and Authorization

- **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely, using environment variables or secure vaults. Do not hard-code sensitive information directly into the codebase.

- **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to sensitive functions and data. Ensure that only authorized users can perform actions that affect security.

### 3. Data Protection

- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Use HTTPS for all API communications and secure storage solutions for sensitive data.

- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging for security-related events (e.g., failed login attempts, unauthorized access). Regularly review logs for suspicious activities.

### 4. Secure Development Practices

- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities and ensure adherence to security practices.

- **Static Code Analysis**: Use static analysis tools to scan the code for vulnerabilities before deployment.

- **Security Testing**: Perform regular security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments, to identify and remediate security weaknesses.

### 5. Incident Response

- **Incident Reporting**: Establish a clear procedure for reporting security incidents. All team members should be aware of how to report potential security breaches or vulnerabilities.

- **Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident response plan that outlines the steps to take in the event of a security breach, including communication strategies and recovery procedures.

## Compliance

All team members are required to comply with this security policy. Non-compliance may result in disciplinary action, including removal from the project or legal consequences.

## Review and Updates

This security policy will be reviewed and updated annually or as needed based on changes in the codebase, technology, or threat landscape.

By following this security policy, we aim to create a secure environment for the development and use of the MDE Lazy Hunter project.
